âœ… Part 1: Mapper Function
Here's an example of a mapper function to convert your snake_case DB record to a camelCase API-friendly object.

Assume your raw DB object looks like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "processing_status": "completed",
  "ocr_confidence": 0.98,
  "ai_confidence": 0.95,
  "id": 123
}
ðŸ§­ JavaScript/Node.js Mapper Example
js
Copy
Edit
function mapBusinessCardToCamelCase(record) {
  return {
    id: record.id,
    status: record.processing_status,
    ocrConfidence: record.ocr_confidence,
    aiConfidence: record.ai_confidence
  };
}
If you are dealing with an array:

js
Copy
Edit
function mapBusinessCardsArray(records) {
  return records.map(mapBusinessCardToCamelCase);
}
âœ… Part 2: OpenAPI 3.1.0 Spec
Now let's define an OpenAPI spec for an endpoint like GET /business-cards that returns a list of business cards with the camelCase fields.

          type: string
          description: Status of the business card processing (e.g., pending, completed)
        ocrConfidence:
          type: number
          format: float
          description: Confidence score of the OCR process
        aiConfidence:
          type: number
          format: float
          description: Confidence score of the AI prediction
âœ… Next Steps
Backend: Use the mapBusinessCardToCamelCase() function in your API route/controller before returning data.

Frontend: Now receives properly named fields like ocrConfidence instead of ocr_confidence.

API Contract: You can share this OpenAPI spec with your frontend team or use it to generate client SDKs.
